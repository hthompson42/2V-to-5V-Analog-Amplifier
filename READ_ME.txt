Version1 schematic contains a simple RC low pass filter at the input with potentiometer to adjust the cut-off frequency.  The filter is connected to a non-inverting op amp to amplify the signal with a potentiometer to adjust the gain.

Version2 schematic contains an active low pass filter with inverting op amp to filter out more noise than the RC filter would.  It has a potentiometer to adjust the cut-off frequency.  It is attached to a second inverting op amp to so the output signal is not inverted, which also has a potentiometer to adjust the gain.

Thank you for allowing me to turn this in during the week as I was traveling when this was due.  I wanted to turn this in as soon as possible and am also new to KiCad, realizing I chose components that were not in the basic PCB footprint libraries after completing the schematics, so I have not done PCB layouts for the circuits.  I can show you print outs of detailed multi-layered PCB layouts I have done in the past though.

Sincerely,

Hannah Thompson
